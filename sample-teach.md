# Welcome!
Hello and welcome! This is an introduction to Swift. Swift is the programming lanugage used in the creation of iOS and MacOS applications. I hope you enjoy your time today!

## Getting Set Up

 - Set your zoom name to your first name and your preferred pronouns. ex: Ashanti (she/her)
 - Sign into [replit.com](https://replit.com/~)
 
 ## Learning Norms
 
 - Please mute your microphone unless you are speaking.
 - Have your camera on if possible!
 - If you have questions, please type them in the chat!
 - Try to share out so we can learn from each other in this space.

---

## Goals for Today
- Become comfortable using replit
- Create and reassign variables
- Variables vs Constants




## Reassigning Variables

The code block below is written in Swift and in an effort to promote learning through exploration, we will not be describing exactly what it does.

```swift
var firstName = "Parisa"
print ("Welcome to Try Coding, \(firstName)!")

firstName = "Malik"
print ("Welcome to Try Coding, \(firstName)!")

var favoriteNumber = 13
print(favoriteNumber)
```

### Try It: Exploring Reassigning Variables
>Read the code above and predict what will happen when it is run. Try to explain why.
>
>Now type the code into your replit and run it. Does it verify or falsify your prediction?
>
>Try creating your own variables.


## Variables vs Constants
So far we have only seen variables, denoted with `var`. As we have seen, variables are used to store information for our code!  In swift there are also constants. Below is a code block and in an effort to promote learning through exploration, we will not be describing exactly what it does.

```swift
let firstName = Carlos
firstName = Sandra

print(firstName)
```

>Read the code above and predict what will happen when it is run. Try to explain why.

Create variables and constants for various parts about you, such as your name, your hometown, your favorite color and food, and anything else you think someone would be interested to know about you. Think about which of these should be variables, and which should be constants. Try to come up with at least 8 constants and variables in total.

Print each of these using print() statements and inserting the variable or constant in the parentheses.

Create a constant called introduction. This should be a readable sentence or paragraph that includes all of the constants and variables you made and combines them into a single string.

Hints: You have already seen string interpolation once today, but you can also look up string interpolation in Swift to learn how to turn variables into text. Google is your friend here. ðŸ˜‰
